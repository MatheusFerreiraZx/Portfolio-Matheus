          and TailwindCSS.

            users. I excel in creating user-friendly applications, enhancing
            performance, and integrating complex features. My strong
            communication skills and ability to build quick connections help me

            for challenges, I am always eager to learn and grow.{" "}

          Outside of work, I am passionate about technology and soccer. I enjoy
          reading, working out at the gym, playing video games, and watching
          soccer matches. I'm always up for a good conversation and am fluent in
          both English and Portuguese.
